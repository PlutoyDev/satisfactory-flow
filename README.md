A tool to help you plan your factory in Satisfactory using a node-based graph editor.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is still in early development and is not ready for use.

## Legacy Version

I have previously worked on [PlutoyDev/satisfactory-planning-tool](https://github.com/PlutoyDev/satisfactory-planning-tool) which is a similar project that never got finished. This project is a complete rewrite of that project with a new design and new features. Some part of the codebase will be reused from the old project.
